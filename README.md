# Muledump.NET

This tool is an items and stat focused account manager for the game RotMG. It is built using .NET MAUI and Blazor Hybrid, allowing it to run on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS from a single codebase.

## Features

*   **Comprehensive Account Details**: View detailed stats for your characters and pets, along with all items across inventory containers.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Runs on Windows, macOS, Android, and iOS.
*   **Familiar UI**: A user interface designed to look and feel like the original Muledump, built with Blazor.
*   **Asset Extraction**: Utilizes `RotMGAssetExtractor` to extract all necessary game data directly, eliminating the need for third-party tools or resources that old MD relied on.

## Installation

1.  Navigate to the [**Releases**](https://github.com/TadusPro/MDTadusMod/releases) page.
2.  Download the latest version for your operating system. You will find two options:
    *   **Installer**: Guides you through a standard installation process and includes an auto-updater to keep the application current.
    *   **Portable**: A `.zip` file that you can extract and run anywhere without installation.
3.  Run the application.

## For Developers

If you want to contribute to the project or build it from source, follow these instructions.

### Tech Stack

*   **.NET 8**
*   **.NET MAUI**
*   **Blazor Hybrid**
*   **C#**

### Prerequisites

*   [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
*   .NET MAUI workload. You can install it by running the following command:
    ```shell
    dotnet workload install maui
    ```
*   Visual Studio 2022 with the .NET Multi-platform App UI development workload installed.

### Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/TadusPro/MDTadusMod
    ```
2.  Open the solution file (`.sln`) in Visual Studio 2022.

### Building and Running

1.  Set the startup project to `MDTadusMod`.
2.  Select the target framework/platform (e.g., Windows Machine, Android Emulator, or a physical device).
3.  Press F5 or click the "Start" button to build and run the application.

### Project Structure

The solution includes two primary projects:
*   **MDTadusMod**: The main .NET MAUI application.
*   **[RotMGAssetExtractor](https://github.com/TadusPro/RotMGAssetExtractor)**: A class library responsible for extracting game assets. `MDTadusMod` includes a project reference to `RotMGAssetExtractor`. When you open the solution in Visual Studio, this reference should be automatically resolved.

### Publishing

To publish the application for Windows, run the following command:

```shell
dotnet publish -c Release -f net8.0-windows10.0.19041.0 -r win-x64 `
  -p:WindowsPackageType=None -p:PublishReadyToRun=false
```
